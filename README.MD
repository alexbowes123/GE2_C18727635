# Expanding on idea
If there is time or the project seems a bit empty, I may add in a sci fi element and add in aliens that attack the jets if that is alright.

# Models
The models currently being used will be replaced over time as the author creates new ones in Blender. As of week 6, the models used are taken from the asset store.
